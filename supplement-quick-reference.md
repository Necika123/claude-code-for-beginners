## Effective Prompting Patterns

### The Specific Pattern
```
In [file], add a [feature] that [does X] when [condition]
```

```

### The Iterative Pattern
```
Create a basic [thing]
[After reviewing] Now add [enhancement]
[After testing] Fix [issue]
```

### The Context Pattern
```
I'm building [project]. I need to [goal].
The current structure is [description].
Please [specific request].
```

---

## Configuration

### Set API Key
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

### Config file location
```

```

### Set config values
```bash
claude config set [key] [value]
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

✅ Be specific about what you want
✅ Provide context about your project
✅ Review changes before accepting
✅ Ask for explanations when learning
✅ Use version control (Git)
✅ Test changes incrementally
✅ Break complex tasks into steps

### Don'ts

❌ Don't give vague instructions
❌ Don't skip testing after changes
❌ Don't blindly accept all changes
❌ Don't forget to commit working code
❌ Don't ask for too many changes at once
❌ Don't ignore error messages

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit Claude Code |
| `Ctrl+D` | End input |
| `Up Arrow` | Previous command |
| `Down Arrow` | Next command |

## Common File Patterns

### Glob Patterns

```
*.js                 # All .js files in current directory
**/*.py              # All .py files recursively
src/**/*.tsx         # All .tsx files in src/
**/test/**           # All files in test directories
**/*test*            # All files with 'test' in name
```

### Grep Patterns (Regex)

```
function.*login      # Functions containing 'login'
import.*from         # Import statements
TODO|FIXME           # TODO or FIXME comments
class\s+\w+          # Class definitions
```

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Claude Code won't start
```bash
# Check version
claude --version

# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version

# Reinstall
npm install -g claude-code
```

### API key not working
```bash
# Set it again
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"

# Or use config
claude config set apiKey "your-key"
```

### Changes not applying
```
Please show me the file to verify the changes
```

### Command failed
```
Can you explain the error and try a different approach?
```

---

## Project-Specific Templates

### React Component
```
Create a React functional component called [Name] that:
- Accepts props: [list props]
- Displays [UI elements]
- Handles [events]
```

### API Endpoint
```
Add a new [HTTP method] endpoint at [path] that:
- Accepts [parameters]
- Returns [data]
- Handles errors
```

### Database Model
```
Create a [ORM] model for [entity] with fields:
- [field]: [type]
- [field]: [type]
Include validation and relationships.
```

### Test Suite
```
Create tests for [function/component] that verify:
- [test case 1]
- [test case 2]
- Edge cases and errors
```

---

## Language-Specific Patterns

### Python
```
Create a Python script that [purpose]
Use [libraries]
Include error handling and logging
```

### JavaScript/Node
```
Create a Node.js [type] using [framework]
Use ES6+ syntax
Include async/await for async operations
```

### TypeScript
```
Create a TypeScript [type] with proper types
Use interfaces for [data structures]
Enable strict mode
```

## Quick Debugging Checklist

When something isn't working:

1. **Read the error:** `What does this error mean?`
2. **Check the file:** `Show me [filename] around line [X]`
3. **Find similar code:** `Find other places where [X] works`
4. **Check dependencies:** `Are all dependencies installed?`
5. **Test in isolation:** `Create a simple test for [feature]`
6. **Ask for help:** `Help me debug [specific issue]`
